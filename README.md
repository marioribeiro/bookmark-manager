# Bookmark Manager
In this week challege I'll build a web app that stores web bookmarks in a database.

## User Stories

```

As a time-pressed user
So that I can quickly go to web sites I regularly visit
I would like to see a list of links on the homepage

As a time-pressed user

I would like to see links in descending chronological order

As a time-pressed user
So that I can save a website
I would like to add the site's address and title to my bookmark manager

As a time-pressed user
